#### Video and Audio Content

[Video $ Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.  

The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions `<video> and <audio>` elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>` element.  

**src:** In the same way as for the `<img>` element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

**controls:** Users must be able to control video and audio playback.You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.  

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?  

fallback content: This will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the `<video>` element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers.

4. Write a very short story where `<audio> and <video>` are characters.  

An "MP3 file" is actually an MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3) audio track stored within an MPEG or MPEG-2 container. This is especially interesting since while most browsers don't support using MPEG media in the <video> and <audio> elements, they may still support MP3 due to its popularity.

#### A Complete Guide To Grid

[Complete guide grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?  

CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.
Flexbox is one-directional flow system.

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.  

**Grid Item:** The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

```css
<div class="container">
  <div class="item item-1"> </div>
  <div class="item item-2"> </div>
  <div class="item item-3"> </div>
</div>
```

**Grid Line:** The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

#### Responsive Images

[Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?  

To make images that work well on devices with widely different screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features.

2. Define the following `<img>` attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.  

The standard `<img>` element traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file:  

```html
<img src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />
```

We can however use two attributes — srcset and sizes — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one.

```html
<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />
  ```

3. How is `srcset` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?  

`srcset` defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.
`sizes` defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true.

### Class Audio - Visual - Grid Demo

[Video](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp)
[Audio](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp)

#### AUDIO

```html
<h2>Audio</h2>
<audio src="assets/demo2.mp3"></audio>

```

- controls : true/false
- muted: true/false
- loop: true/false
- volume: range 0.0 (silent) to 1 (loudest)
- width: absolute or percentage value
- height: absolute value, no percentage
- poster: alt image of the first frame before playback

```html
<audio controls autoplay muted loop volume>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

```js
const randomizer = document.getElementById('randomizer');
randomizer.addEventListener('click', function(){
    randomizer.volume = 0.5;
})
```

#### VIDEO

```html
<h2>Video</h2>
<video src="assets/demo.mov" width="50%" control autoplay poster="image.jpg"></video>
```

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## DISPLAY GRID

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

[Display Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid.php)

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr 10% auto; */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

## Javascript

```js
let array = [];

function randomNum() {
 return Math.floor(Math.random() * array.lenght);
}

// Check different number
while (goat1 === goat2){
    goat2 = randomNum();
}
```
