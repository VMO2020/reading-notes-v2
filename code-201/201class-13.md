[The Science Behind Public Speaking](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/public-speaking-tips/)  

1. I try to focus on myself and the subject of my presentation.  

2. I practice my speech, before the presentation.  

### localStorage

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?  
To store information locally on a user's computer to create better UX.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?  
Usually stores a string with user preferences.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Local storage only accepts strings of data. If you want to use an object, you have to use `JSON.stringify(info)` to store it, and `JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'info' ) )` to read the information.

```js
var car = {};
car.wheels = 4;
car.doors = 2;
car.sound = 'vroom';
car.name = 'Lightning McQueen';
console.log( car );
localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) );
console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );
```

### Reflection

Working in teams using Github is more difficult than I expected, because with no experience we did a lot of build conflicts. During the first day working on separate branches we destroyed our code, but we learned our lesson and the next day we were ready to work as a team, and we had no version conflicts.
