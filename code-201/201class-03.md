### Learn HTML

#### Ordered and Unordered lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?  
When we don't need numeric ordering. The `<ul>` element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square.

```html
<ul>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ul>
```

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?  
Using the list-style-type CSS property sets the marker (such as a disc, character, or custom counter style) of a list item element.  
Partial list:  

```css
list-style-type: disc;
list-style-type: circle;
list-style-type: square;
list-style-type: decimal;
list-style-type: "-";
```

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?  
When you need a list in strict order. Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding marker, such as a number or letter.

```html
<ol>
  <li>Fee</li>
  <li>Fi</li>
  <li>Fo</li>
  <li>Fum</li>
</ol>
```

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?  

    1. Using the start attribute

    ```html
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Speedwalk Stu</li>
        <li>Saunterin' Sam</li>
        <li>Slowpoke Rodriguez</li>
    </ol>
    ```

    2. Using Roman Numeral type  

    ```html
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <li>List of Grievances</li>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
    </ol>
    ````

### Learn CSS

#### The Box Model

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?  

The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model.  

- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.  

- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.  

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.  
- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.  
- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.  
- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

### Learn JS

#### Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops  

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?  
Arrays is the ordered way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name.  
Array we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?  

```js
const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
````

Yes, people array is valid.  
Items in an array are numbered, starting from zero. This number is called the items index. So the first item has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. You can access individual items in the array using bracket notation and supplying the items index, in the same way that you accessed the letters in a string.  

```js
console.log(people[0]);
result:
[
    "pete",
    32,
    "librarian",
    null
]
```

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.  

| Name                      | Shorthand operator | Meaning     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Assignment                | x = f()            | x = f()     |
| Addition assignment       | x += f()           | x = x + f() |
| Subtraction assignment    | x -= f()           | x = x - f() |
| Multiplication assignment | x *= f()           | x = x * f() |
| Division assignment       | x /= f()           | x = x / f() |

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.  

```js
 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

 // "c" will be ignored: result (a + b)
 '10dog'
```

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.  

```js
const status = age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor";
```

6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.  

```js
// Displaying all the books on a digital bookshelf: **A for loop**
const bookshelf = ['book1', 'book2', 'book3'];

for (let book of bookshelf) {
 console.log(book);
}
```
