### Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?  
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

```html
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

2. The href attribute contains what information?  
The href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?  
Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.  
If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users.  

Use clear link wording:  

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.  

4. Image links  
If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the `<a>` element to wrap the image file referenced with the `<img>` element.

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <img src="mdn_logo.svg" alt="MDN Web Docs homepage" />
</a>
```

### CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?  
The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?  
block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, which is based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb). Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. In English, for example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode) block-level elements are laid out vertical.  
Inline elements behave differently. They don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line.  

3. ***block-level*** positioning is the default for every html element.  

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.  

- An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.  
- We can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.  

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
Fixed positioning works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.

### Learn Javascript

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.  

- Creating a function is also known as function declaration.
- Invoke is a fancy word for run, or execute a function.

```js
// function declaration
function myFunction() {
  alert('hello');
}

// Invoke a function:
myFunction();
```

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?  
 Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.  

 ```js
 function example(parameter) {
  console.log(parameter); // Output = foo
}

const argument = "foo";

example(argument);
```

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:  

- Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
- Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
- Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
- Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

1. Greater efficiency:
Pair programming takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).  
When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.  

2. Engaged collaboration:  

When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.  
Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help.
