### Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

[Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.  
Because a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.  
Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.  
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

[HTML table basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?  

- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
- Tables produce tag soup
- Tables are not automatically responsive  

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

`<tr>: create a row container, <th>: create a column heading & <td>: create a column body element`  

[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
Constructor is a function to create more than one object from a single object definition.  
It's a way of defining the "shape" of an object, the set of methods and properties it can have, and then **creating as many objects as we want**, simply by updating property values that are different.  

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  
Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script. We can use **this** to reference to new object we are created.

[Object Prototypes Using A Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)  

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.  

In JavaScript, an object can inherit properties of another object. The object from where the properties are inherited is called the prototype.

 Button (.btn solid) inherit properties of Button (.btn).
 Button (.btn) is called the prototype.

## Things I want to know more about

Prototypes.

### Constructor functions (this => new object we are created)

```js
// "this" is a reference to the element we are creating

function CookieStand(name, minCustomer, maxCustomer, avgCookieSale, imageFileName) {
 this.name = name;
 this.minCustomer = minCustomer;
 this.maxCustomer = maxCustomer;
 this.avgCookieSale = avgCookieSale;
 this.customersEachHour = [];
 this.cookiesEachHour = [];
 this.totalDailyCookies = 0;
 this.calcCustomersEachHour = function() {
    //code
 };
 this.imageUrl = "image/" + imageFileName
};

this.age = this.generateAge();
```

```js
const cookieStore1 = new CookieStand("Seattle", 23, 65, 6.3);
const cookieStore2 = new CookieStand("Tokyo", 3, 24, 1.2);
const cookieStore3 = new CookieStand("Dubai", 11, 38, 3.7);
const cookieStore4 = new CookieStand("Paris", 20, 38, 4.6);
const cookieStore5 = new CookieStand("Lima", 2, 16, 4.6);

console.log(cookieStore1);
console.log(cookieStore2);
```

#### Methods get added to the constructor's prototype

```js
// Create a new prototype object
CookieStand.prototype.getAvgCookieCount = function () {
  console.log(`This store name is ${this.name}`);
};

CookieStand.prototype.generateAge = function () {
  return randomInRange(3, 12) + " months";
};

CookieStand.prototype.chris = "Chris";

cookieStore1.getAvgCookieCount();
cookieStore2.getAvgCookieCount();

CookieStand.prototype.render = function () {
    // Add article
    const containerElem = document.getElementById("id-name");
    const articleElem = document.createElement('article');
    containerElem.appendChild(articleElem);

    // Add the article heading
    const headingElem = document.getElement("h2");
    articleElem.appendChild(headingElem);
    headingElem.textContent = this.name

    // add a paragraph
     const paraElem = document.getElement("p");
     articleElem.appendChild(paraElem);
     paraElem.textContent = `${this.name} text...`;

     // Add a ul
      const ulElem = document.getElement("ul");
      articleElem.appendChild(ulElem);

    // Image
    const imgElem = document.getElement("img");
    articleElem.appendChild(imgElem);
    imgElem.setAttribute("src", this.imageUrl);
    imgElem.setAttribute("alt", "picture of " + this.name);

    // Random
    function randomNum(min, max) {
        return Math.ceil(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
    }
}

// Invoke the function render
seattle.render();

```

## Reflection

> "I think adapting to a new job or a new environment is the hardest part, because we humans don't like to adapt, but we have to adapt to survive. It's usually easy and comfortable to follow the same routine, but it's the wrong way to go.
At my age I'm ready to adapt, it's been a long time but I've learned.".
