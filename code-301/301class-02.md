## Readings: State and Props  

### React lifecycle

[React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?  

**render**
  
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?  

**Mounting: Constructor**

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates`

Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting are the three phases of the component lifecycle.

**1-constructor-render-componentDidMount->2-React Updates->3-componentWillUnmount**

4. What does `componentDidMount` do?  

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions.

## React State Vs Props

[React State Vs Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)  

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?  

Functions, objects and values.

2. What is the big difference between props and state?  

**state** is handled inside of that component and you can updated it inside the component while **props** are handled outside of the component and must be updated outside of teh component.  

3. When do we re-render our application?  

When the state changes.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?  

Anything that you can change, such as counters, forms, selectors, and inputs, must use a state.
