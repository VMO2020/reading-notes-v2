#### Section Questions & Answers

1. What is HTML and why do we use it?  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

</p>

- **The opening tag:** This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
- **The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
- **The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.  

### HTML basic

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?  
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things, attributes that look like the following:

</p>

4. What is a semantic element?  
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.  
Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div> and <span>` - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: `<form> , <table> , and <article>` - Clearly defines its content.
