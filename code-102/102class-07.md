### Section Questions & Answers

1- What is control flow?  
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

2- What is a JavaScript function?  
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

3- What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?  
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:  

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)  
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code  
Automatically (self invoked)  

4- What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?  
The () Operator Invokes the Function  
Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.  

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

. Functions are invoked by using parenthesis.
. The code in a function is executed at the time the function is invoked.
